# 🔧 Tools-Share-Management-Platform ~ Playwright Integration

----

## 🎭 End-to-End Testing 
This project includes **Playwright** for end-to-end testing of the Angular application.

- ✅ **Initial Setup with Page Object Model**: Introduced Playwright using the classic `Page Object Model (POM)` to structure and reuse selectors and actions.
- 🎬 **Screenplay Pattern**: Refactored the test architecture using the `Screenplay pattern`, modeling interactions through actors and tasks.
- 📸 **Visual Regression Testing**: Added `screenshot-based` tests to catch unexpected UI changes and enhance visual coverage.
- 

Playwright configuration and test files are located in the [`e2e/`](https://github.com/ferrara94/Tools-Share-Management-Platform/tree/tests/playwright-integration/tool-sharing-ui/e2e) directory.
